To create a Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically, the purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

* The Descision Tree Classifier is created and is visaulized graphically. Also the prediction was calculated using decision tree algorithm and accuracy of the model was evaluated.
